# The provided Dockerfile looks like it should build a working Docker image for your .NET Core application. 
# It starts by using the "mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0" as the build stage, 
# this is the .NET Core SDK image that includes the necessary tools to build and publish the application.
# The next step, is to copy all the csproj files in the current working directory to the container. 
# Then it runs dotnet restore command which restore the dependencies required for the application.
# The next step is to copy all the files in the current working directory to the container.
# Then it runs dotnet publish command which build and publish the application to the output directory 'out'
# The final stage uses the "mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0" as the base image, 
# this is an optimized runtime image that includes only the necessary runtime to run the application. 
# It set working directory to /app and copies all the files in the 'out' directory into the container.
# Finally, it specifies the ENTRYPOINT command which will run the application's DLL file upon starting the container.
# It should be noted that the ENTRYPOINT command should match with the name of the dll generated after your build.
# Please check the dll name and update accordingly.
# This should create a Docker image for your application, and when you run the image, it should start the application in a container.
